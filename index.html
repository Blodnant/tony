							The Madness of Courage describes how, when forced down by engine damage after destroying a German fighter, Gilbert ignored intensive shelling in order to repair his aircraft and return to base. But a few weeks later, he was shot down and captured. And thus began a distinguished career in prison breaking.

								He tunnelled out of Heidelberg prison camp
and later hid among boxes on a horse-drawn
cart to get away from Crefeld, each time
being recaptured. Then, in Ströhen, Gilbert
and several companions concealed themselves
in a claustrophobically small space they had
excavated under the floor of the bathhouse.
They remained there for seventeen hours,
while a fruitless search for them was carried
out, and eventually emerged and successfully
reached Holland.
							</p>
								<p>
									Meticulously told by Gilbert’s great-nephew,
the critically acclaimed intelligence historian
Tony Insall, The Madness of Courage is a
gripping true story about a remarkable man
at a time before the Geneva Convention was
signed, when conditions for prisoners of war
were often appalling and the British War
Office did little to help prisoners escape.
Instead, Gilbert’s family, assisted by French
intelligence, gave him the support he needed
to break out of captivity in an extraordinary
feat of bravery, resilience and ingenuity.
